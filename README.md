# Machine-Learning-Projects
Machine Learning Projects - Spring 2025 class.

For learning Machine Learning, I am using the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow” by Aurélien Géron, 2022, O’Reilly Media, Inc. (3rd edition).

In this repo, as the semester goes, I will post:
1. My coding assessment on SVMs;
2. Class exercises/projects I had on:
   Supervised and Unsupervised learning;
   Over-fitting, under-fitting, and bias;
   Choosing decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines;
   Regularization, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning;
3. Implementing machine learning algorithms using sci-kit-learn and Keras;
4. Preprocessing and cleaning datasets for machine learning tasks;
5. Training, evaluating, and fine-tuning machine learning models.
